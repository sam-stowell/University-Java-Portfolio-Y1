3. Some employees are also responsible for quality control, besides covering cakes, they have an extra
   responsibility to periodically inspect the cakes covered by other employees. Quality controllers have
   the same wage rates and rules as a standard employee plus earn an additional 12% for being a
   quality controller.
   Complete your programme by adding the functionality to add one or more quality controller(s) to
   the same team used in the previous programme.
   Create a quality controller called Rabia who has covered 385 cakes, add them to the team and
   display the table and statistics as used in the previous programme. Add an identifier (such as ‘QC’) to
   denote the quality controller.
   If developed correctly, this programme will demonstrate an outstanding understanding of the OO
   principles covered in the module
